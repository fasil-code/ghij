        'ans':'''This study is a web-app-based cognitive assessment. 
        An alternative to standard pen-paper cognitive assessment. 
        It is designed to test problem-solving abilities, social and mental
        skills, and much more through its quick game-like tasks. It is unlike 
        any standard psychology task as it puts the user in charge, and tasks 
        can be performed at home without the assistance of a psychologist. 
        This tool is similar to a number of brain training apps that you might be familiar with but tets a wider
        range of cognitive functions.
        The aim of this study is to be able to measure cognition in the real world accurately. 
        The hope is that we will be able to use this tool to know when cognition is changing, 
        which may be important in the FTD population when it comes to treatment outcomes

       If you agree to take part, you will be required to complete the assessment, which includes a 
       series of short tests that measure cognition. The assessment takes approximately 30 minutes to
       complete from start to finish. Data from the assessment will be transformed into s spreadsheet and 
       automatically sent to the cloud server. No data will be stored on the personal device. 
       A researcher will be notified when data has been uploaded to the server, and they will securely 
       log on and retrieve it.They will then download the spreadsheet from the IIT Kharagpurâ€™s server.

         It is possible that these tasks may highlight aspects of your cognition that you feel are not
         as strong as they should be. Everybody is different, people will perform better on some tasks
         than others. It is important to remember that these tasks are designed to be difficult, so do 
         not worry if you feel like you have not performed well.
