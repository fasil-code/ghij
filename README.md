<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com)

This is a research study of the web app-based cognitive assessment. Before deciding to participate, you need to understand why the research is being conducted and what your participation will involve.
Frontotemporal dementia is an uncommon type of dementia that causes problems with behaviour and language.Dementia is the name for problems with mental abilities caused by gradual changes and damage in the brain. Frontotemporal dementia affects the front and sides of the brain (the frontal and temporal lobes) Dementia mostly affects people over 65, but frontotemporal dementia tends to start at a younger age. Most cases are diagnosed in people aged 45-65, although it can also affect younger or older people. Like other types of dementia, frontotemporal dementia tends to develop slowly and get gradually worse over several years.

Various test used to diagonise FTD:
* Emotion Recognation Test
* ACE III
* Trail Making Test
* Pulse Tracking Test
* VisuoSpatial Test

The objective of the project is to develop a tool for the detection of dementia(FTD) in individuals based on their performance in various cognitive tests. The project was undertaken as part of a research initiative to find a non-invasive and cost-effective method for early diagnosis of dementia.

Methodology:
The project involved conducting various cognitive tests on a sample population consisting of both healthy individuals and those with confirmed dementia. The tests were designed to assess different aspects of cognitive function, such as memory, attention, and executive function.

The data collected from the tests was then analyzed using various statistical techniques to identify the key features that could be used to distinguish between the healthy and dementia groups. The features identified will be used to develop a machine learning model that will predict the presence of dementia in individuals based on their test performance.
